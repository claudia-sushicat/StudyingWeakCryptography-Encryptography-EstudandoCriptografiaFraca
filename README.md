Hello world!
Today, I was inspired to do something new!
Those days i'm learning some basics of computer networks, ethical hacking, information security and we *always* have that starting in online classes about history of all theses things
then, I heard something about crypthography ( weak cryptography ), which motives me to try to write something in .py and here we are.
This repository is about  taking the hands dirty because this is the best form to learn something xD
